Collections : Arrays are basically static data structures as 
once they are assigned, we cannot alter the size. For this, we need the help 
of collections. 

Collections stores data w.r.t. Object format, collections can grow to any 
size. 

Collections are coming from util package. 

java.util package that which contains all collection data. 

Scanner : Used to read the data from the keyboard. 

Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in); 

nextInt()
nextLine()

etc...

In collections, we have 3 top level interfaces as

List : This interface contains the list of values. In this we have ArrayList, LinkedList and Vector. 

Set : Used to eliminate the duplicates from the given collection. 

	HashSet and LinkedHashSet are falling under Set interface. 

SortedSet : Allows you to sort the data on specific fields. TreeSet is falling under SortedSet.
