Angular Services


1) What is Service : 

Allows you to re-use the business logic across multiple components. 

Once you write the service, that code can be accessable across multiple
components. 

2) How to Create Service

You can create a service, as 

ng g service service_name 


3) What is HTTP Service

This is an external service implemented by various programming languages,
can be called in component and we can bind the data. 



4) How to configure HTTP Services

npm install @angular/http@latest

npm install rxjs-compat --save 

5) What is Observable 

When you send any request to service, it returns two values 

It returns two values as Resolve and Reject 

Resolve -> If service served successfully. 

Reject -> If service contains any errors. 


These are captured by using Observables. 

Why we prefer observables is 

	-> Observable can be accessable asynchronously 

	-> Observables can be cancellable 

	-> Observables can transmit more than one value over the time. 

import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

7) What is Map Operator

Used to convert json data into corresponding class object. 



8) How to Read JSON Data
